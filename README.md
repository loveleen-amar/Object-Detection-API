# Object-Detection-API
This project introduces an API for object detection. The server will do all the heavy work for the client even if client has low-end system. This API can be used by anyone for the object detection task freely.  An image clicked/selected by the client will be sent to the API end-point in specific format and then API would do the object detection task and send back the object detected image. The received image will be obtained by the client with different objects classified within that image. YOLO v3.0 algorithm is used in the backend  that would perform the object detection task.
